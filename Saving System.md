## Saving
If you like your drawing and want to save it, press the 'Save' button on the ground.
This will save all information needed to recreate your drawing
as well as a preview of it in the '\<Beat Saber\>/UserData/Scribble/Save.png' file.

## Loading
If you press the 'Load' button on the ground, the drawing located in the '\<Beat Saber\>/UserData/Scribble/Save.png' file gets loaded into the scene.

!Important!
Keep in mind that the loading process is additive, which means the loaded drawing gets added to the scene (as often as you press the load button).
If you only want the loaded drawing, press 'Clear' before pressing 'Clear'.

## Sharing your drawing
If you want another person to load you drawing:
1. Send the '\<Beat Saber\>/UserData/Scribble/Save.png' file to the other PC
2. Put the file into the same location on the other PC
3. Press the 'Load' button to load the drawing
